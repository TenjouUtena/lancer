# PSD File Upload Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented file upload functionality for artist Base PSD files, replacing the previous URL-based system with direct file uploads supporting files up to 100MB with configurable limits.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Configuration (appsettings.json)
- Added `FileUpload` section with configurable limits:
  - `MaxFileSizeBytes`: 10MB for images
  - `MaxPsdFileSizeBytes`: 100MB for PSD files
  - `AllowedImageExtensions`: [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", ".webp"]
  - `AllowedPsdExtensions`: [".psd"]

### 2. Database Model Updates (Models/Artist.cs)
- Added new fields to `ArtistBase` model:
  - `OriginalPsdFileName`: string
  - `OriginalPsdFileSize`: long
  - `ModifiedPsdFileName`: string
  - `ModifiedPsdFileSize`: long
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing URL fields

### 3. S3Service Enhancements (Services/S3Service.cs)
- Enhanced `UploadFileAsync` method with optional content type parameter
- Added `UploadPsdFileAsync` method specifically for PSD files with metadata
- Added `GetContentType` helper method for proper MIME type detection
- Added metadata storage for original filename and file type

### 4. Controller Updates (Controllers/ArtistBasesController.cs)
- Updated `ArtistBaseUploadModel` to include:
  - `IFormFile? OriginalPsdFile`
  - `IFormFile? ModifiedPsdFile`
  - Maintained URL fields for backward compatibility
- Added validation helper methods:
  - `ValidateAndUploadImageFile`
  - `ValidateAndUploadPsdFile`
- Enhanced create and update endpoints to handle PSD file uploads
- Added proper file cleanup in delete operations
- Implemented configurable file size validation
- Added `FileUploadResult` class for consistent error handling

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Artist Base Form Updates (artists/artistbase.js)
- Added state management for PSD files:
  - `originalPsdFile`
  - `modifiedPsdFile`
- Replaced URL input fields with file upload inputs
- Added file information display (name, size)
- Maintained URL inputs as fallback for backward compatibility
- Enhanced form submission to include PSD files in FormData
- Added proper file size display and validation feedback

### 2. UI/UX Improvements
- Used purple-themed styling for PSD file section to distinguish from images
- Added file icons and size information
- Implemented drag-and-drop ready file inputs
- Added progress indicators and loading states
- Maintained existing Tailwind CSS design consistency

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. File Upload Support

- Metadata storage (filename, size)

### 2. Backward Compatibility
- Existing URL fields remain functional
- Gradual migration path for existing data
- Both upload and URL methods available in UI

### 3. Security & Validation

- Easily adjustable for different environments

## Database Schema
The database schema was updated to include the new PSD metadata fields while maintaining backward compatibility with existing URL-based storage.

- Maintains existing API compatibility

## Future Enhancements
